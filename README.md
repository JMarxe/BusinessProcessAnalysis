# Organization Background

Hannah and Tiger Asian Mart have 40 employees across two locations located in Kendall and Miami. Providing a wide variety of Asian commodities, its mission is to deliver an exceptional shopping experience. Through this providing the service of making Asian items more accessible to the Miami community. Key performance metrics would be the number of sales per day.

# Process Definition

Process components, inputs, outputs, and other processes/systems/entities that the process interacts with.

Firstly we will start with tracking how an employee performs while going through the training process. The second component of the process includes tracking the sales and the profit the organization gained while an employee was on duty. Another component would be the feedback boxes made available to the customers at the exit points. The next component is the software used by the organization, such as a loyalty program application on the customers' mobile devices. Furthermore, an innovative process is also considered to track employee performance by having employees participate in quarterly surveys in which they are responsible for rating the performance of their fellow employees. Also, the organization would be able to track the number and the frequency of errors an employee encountered during their shift. Lastly, the organization will be able to have surveillance regarding an employee finishing the assigned tasks in a timely manner.

Inputs would be customer and employee feedback, number of errors, and tasks performed. Feedback would be collected from surveys, and peer reviews gathered from customers and employees. The number of errors and functions performed would give us a positive or negative performance margin.

The output would be an average employee performance score tracked by multiple components and processes mentioned above.

The input entities would be the employees, management, and HR. Employees will be evaluated on job performance which will help management gather information and be transferred to HR, who will use the information for future decision making.

# Key Process Measures

The key process measure would be employee performance, training, and recruitment process.

- To ensure that turnover rates are lower than previous years.
- The amount of time and money we will invest in one employee.

The manager will check and evaluate the employees' performance of those who desire to quit their job to incentivize and retain those who perform well.

# Key Improvement Targets

In the areas that we have to evaluate each employee's job performance, we will be able to single out each employee and assess their performances and match it to the companies' standards and resolve any issues that might decrease employee performance score and the overall performance of the company. Once we have close eyes on employee performance, customers will be guaranteed the organization's service goals.

1. New Hire goes through a training process and a 30/60- or 90-day probation period with clear expectations, guidelines and roles for the position . **(Probation period to be determined by team)**
2. At the end of the probation period the manager and new hire will sit down to cover what areas have been successful and what needs improvement. This will also include the peer feedback as well as any customer feedback that has been provided. This is the point where it is determined if the employee is hired on a permanent basis or if they are not a good fit with the company. (This is determined by the amount of completed successful items on the checklist form the expectations/guidelines and roles set forth at hire)
3. If employee rates high (example 8/10) employee is hire on as permanent
 If employee rates are low, they are not a good fit. Begin process of finding replacement
4. Hired employees will then go through a 6 month from hire evaluation to be conducted by the manager.
5. At the year evaluation it will be determined $ or % amount for raise and any potential promotion opportunities in the future.
6. Moving forward an employee will receive a mid-year and annual evaluation to determine their performance.

**Team project planning (you can use MS Project to put together a quantitative SOW**

**including WBS, OBS, RAM, schedule and deliverables)**

As we know performance metrics are vital to the employee & corporation for different reasons. The interaction between employees and management would be through systems (registers, scanners, etc.), making analyzing employee performance relatively easy. Implementing these systems include a lot of aspects, there is a software which is responsible for storing all the data that includes sales in cash and card, errors occurred, number of customers checked out and much more. Also, the organization needs to hire a software company to develop the mobile application for the loyalty program. The organization also needs to come up with a set of questions that would be asked to the employees in the surveys that are to be performed quarterly. The management team also needs to come up with innovative ideas for the customers to use the feedback boxes.
